    "Simple vs. Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Simple Linear Regression (SLR) models the relationship between one independent variable (predictor) and one dependent variable (outcome). It assumes a straight-line (linear) relationship. On the other hand, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models the relationship between multiple independent variables and one dependent variable. It presents more complex relationships and  improves predictive power by accounting for potential confounding factors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Continuous vs. Indicator Variable in SLR:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A continuous variable is based on continuous data, data that can take any numerical value in a range (e.g., height, age). In SLR, it's used as a predictor to model a continuous relationship with the outcome. An indicator variable is based on categorical data. It takes binary values (0 or 1) to represent different groups or categories. When used in SLR, it models the difference in means between two categories, assuming the relationship with the outcome is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect of Adding an Indicator Variable in MLR:\n",
    "\n",
    "    When an indicator variable is added alongside a continuous variable in MLR, it introduces the effect of the categorical group on the outcome, while still modeling the relationship with the continuous variable. The model becomes more nuanced, showing how both types of predictors influence the dependent variable. In SLR, the effect of a categorical variable is modeled as a simple shift (e.g., comparing two groups). In MLR, the indicator variable models this shift while also accounting for the continuous variable's effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction Between Continuous and Indicator Variables in MLR:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Adding an interaction term between a continuous and an indicator variable in MLR models how the effect of the continuous variable on the outcome changes depending on the category of the indicator variable. The model captures the different slopes for the continuous variable in each category.\n",

    "Indicator Variables from Non-Binary Categorical Data in MLR:\n",
    "\n",
    "    When using a non-binary categorical variable (e.g., three or more categories) in MLR, it’s typically encoded into binary indicator variables. These indicator variables allow the model to estimate different intercepts for each category of the non-binary variable, essentially comparing the mean of the dependent variable across different categories. For example, a categorical variable Color with three categories (Red, Blue, Green) is encoded into two binary indicator variables, representing Red and Blue, with Green as the reference category: 𝑌=𝛽0+𝛽1⋅Red+𝛽2⋅Blue+𝜖. Variable Red will be 1 when observing the Red category and zero otherwise. The same for the varible Blue when observing the Blue category. The coefficient 𝛽0 represents the intercept, or the expected value of 𝑌 when Color is Green (the reference category). 𝛽1 represents the change in 𝑌 when Color is Red compared to Green. 𝛽2 represents the change in 𝑌 when Color is Blue compared to Green."

    "> _In `formula='HP ~ Q(\"Sp. Def\") * C(Generation)'` the `Q` stands for \"quote\" and is needed to access column names when they have a \"space\" in their name, while the `C` indicates a **categorical** use of what is actually an **integer** valued column. Despite technically being **continuous** numbers, **integer** often simply indicate categories which should not necessarily be treated as an incremental **continuous predictor variable**. Remember, a model such as $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$ means for each unit increase in $x$ the outcome increases \"on average\" by $\\beta_1$; so, if $x$ takes on the values `1` through `6` as the `Generation` **predictor variable** here does, then this means the average value for \"Generation 1\" must be $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$ while for \"Generation 2\" it must be $\\beta_0 + 2\\times \\beta_1$ (and so on up to \"Generation 6\" which must be $\\beta_0 + 6\\times \\beta_1$). This might be a very strange restriction to place on something that is really actually a **categorical predictor variable**. You can see in the given model fit below how this six-level **categorical predictor variable** is actually appropriately treated in the specification of the **linear form** using \"Generation 1\" for the \"baseline\" and **binary indicators** to model the \"contrast\" (\"offsets\") for the other \"Generations\"; and, how these are in turn used in the context of the **interaction** considered by the model specification._ \n",

Significant coefficients typically indicate strong predictors, which would normally imply a higher R-squared since the predictors are having an impact.\n",

    "2. Splitting the Dataset: The dataset is split into two subsets pokeaman_train and pokeaman_test. The split is based on a 50-50 ratio, determined by calculating half of the number of rows in the dataset. This is done using the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection, which randomly shuffles and splits the data into training and testing sets. The training set (pokeaman_train) will be used to train a model, while the test set (pokeaman_test) will be used to evaluate the model's performance after it has been trained. The split is done in a reproducible way by setting a random seed (np.random.seed(130)).\n",

These variables are all treated as continuous predictors (main effects). The interaction between these variables is indicated by the * operator. This means the model will estimate not only the individual effects of each predictor but also how combinations of them affect HP.\n",
    "2. Q(\"Sp. Def\") and Q(\"Sp. Atk\") are the special column names for Special Defense and Special Attack in the dataset. These are added the model as interaction terms using the Q() function to handle column names that contain spaces or special characters. The C() function used to indicate categorical variables isexcluded in the model formula here due to the large number of interaction combinations that could arise from including categorical variables which could overwhelm computer memory and processing power.\n",

    "- Running model4_fit.summary() provides insights into how well this complex model fits the data, and helps assess the significance of both main effects and interaction terms.\n",
    "- The summary will show a list of coefficients for each term, including main effects and interactions, as well as statistical metrics such as p-values, R-squared, and more. Given the complexity of the model, expect the summary to contain a large number of predictors. The results can be used to evaluate which variables or combinations of variables significantly affect HP. However, it's important to consider whether this highly complex model truly improves predictive performance or whether it overfits the data."

    "\n",
    "> _The **overfitting** observed in the previous problem is a question of **model complexity** relative to the amount of information or evidence available in a given dataset (or we could just say \"the amount of data in a dataset\"). The **model fit** for  `model4` resulted in an **overfit model** because the specification of its **linear form** was overly complex (relative to the the amount of available data). Indeed, `model4` is rediculously complex as can be seen from `model4_fit.summary()`. This in turn allowed the **model fit** to \"detect\" idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. If a model is too **complex** then it will find and model \"patterns\" in a **training** dataset which are actually just accidental \"noise\" from the random sampling nature of the dataset. The simpler (or more parsimoneous) `model3` on the other hand was able to identify **predictive associations** in the **training** dataset which did **generalize** to the **testing** dataset. This is because `model3` only sought to understand simpler **predictive association** for which there was enough data in the **training** dataset to reliably detect and obviously identify. And these patterns were indeed sufficiently \"real\" in the sense that they were present and **generalized** into the **testing** dataset as well as the **training** dataset. So they could be \"found\" in the **training** and then used in (**generalized** to) the **testing** dataset._\n",
    "> \n",
    "> _This question therefore addresses the topic of the **evidence** a given dataset provides for the **predictive associations** detected by a **fitted model**. It should be increasingly clear at this point that evidence for a model can be addressed using **coefficent hypothesis testing** in the context of **multiple linear regression**, but that examinations of \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** metrics are what in fact are directly designed to address this question of **generalizability**. That said, this question introduces another consideration of **multicollinearity** as something that affects the **generalizability** of **model fits** in the **multiple linear regression** context. A good question that a ChatBot could help you understand is (a) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if two **predictor variables** are highly **correlated**?\" and (b) \"why is **generalizability** more uncertain if multiple **predictor variables** are highly **multicollinear**?\"_\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The four code cells below are not necessary for answering this question; however, they introduce two very practical helpful tools for the **multiple linear regression** context that are immediately relevant for this question. The first is the so-called **condition number** (of a \"design matrix\") which provides a very simple diagnostic which can serve as a measure the degree of **multicollinearity** that is present in a **model fit**. If this number is \"very large\" then there is a large degree of **multicollinearity** and suggests room for doubt regarding the **generalizability** of the **fitted model**. The second tool(s) are the `center` and `scale` functions. It is best practice to \"center and scale\" **continuous predictor variables** (but not **indicator variables**) in the **multiple linear regression** context as is done below. While \"centering and scaling\" does make interpreting the predictions on the original scale of the data slighly more complicated, it also must be done in order to get a \"true\" evaluation of the degree of **multicollinearity** present in a **model fit** using the **condition number** of the model (\"design matrix\"). The examples below show that the **condition number** reported by a **fitted model** are \"artificially inflacted\" if \"centering and scaling\" is not used. Specically, they show that the **condition number** of `model3_fit` is really `1.66` (as opposed to the \"very large\" `343` which is reported without \"centering and scaling\"); whereas, the **condition number** for `model4_fit` is \"very (VERY) large\" irrespective of \"centering and scaling\", showing that the overwheling presense of **multicollinearity** in `model4_fit` is in fact a very real thing.  Indeed, we have already seen that `model4_fit` is grossly **overfit** and does not remotely **generalize** beyond its **training** dataset. Without knowing this, however, the comically large **condition number** for `model4_fit` (after \"centering and scaling\") makes it abundantly clear that we should have great doubts about the likely **generalizability** of `model4_fit` (even without examining specific aspects of **multicollinearity** directly or examining \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** comparisions)._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _The \"specific aspects of **multicollinearity**\" reference above refer to understanding and attributing the detrmimental affects of specific **predictor variables** towards **multicollinearity**. This can be done using so-called **variance inflation factors**, but this is beyond the scope of STA130. We should be aware that the presence of excessive **multicollinearity** as indicated by a large **condition number** for a (\"centered and scaled\") **fitted model** raises grave concerns regarding the potential **generalizability** of the model._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The `np.corrcoef(model4_spec.exog)` examination of the **correlations** of a \"design matrix\" considered in ths problems prompt is analogous to the examination of the **correlations** present in a dataset that might considered when initially examining the **predictor variables** of a dataset, such as `pokeaman.iloc[:,4:12].corr()`. Indeed, such an examination is often the first step in examining the potential presence of **multicollinearity** among the **predictor variables** of a dataset. However, these are consideration of **pairwise correlation**, whereas **multicollinearity** generalizes this notion to the full collection of **predictor variables** together. A **condition number** for a \"centered and scale\" version of a **fit model** can therefore be viewed as serving the analogous purposes of a multivariate generalization of **pairwise correlation**._\n",

    "The Design Matrix is a table where rows correspond to observations (pokeman data in pokeaman_train dataset) and columns correspond to the predictor variables (Attack, Defense, Speed, Legendary, and their interactions).\n",

    "Multicollinearity occurs when predictors in the design matrix, such as Attack, Defense, and Speed, are highly correlated, leading to redundant information and difficulty in determining the most important variables. This results in inflated standard errors for the regression coefficients, making it hard to assess the true effects of each predictor. The model may fit well to the training data but poorly to unseen data, as seen in the low out-of-sample R-squared value, hindering its ability to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a design matrix, the condition number found in .summary() measures multicollinearity, with a large value indicating numerical instability. In model3_linear_form, the model without interactions, the condition number was 343. This suggests moderate multicollinearity. After centering and scaling continuous variables like Attack and Defense, the condition number improved to 1.66, indicating reduced multicollinearity. However, for model4_linear_form, the model with interactions, the condition number was 12 trillion. After centering and scaling, the condition number went down to the still extremely large value of 2.25 trillion. This suggested that there is significant instability due to complex interactions between predictors. This multicollinearity causes overfitting, where the model fits well to training data but performs poorly on unseen data. It also inflates the variance of regression coefficients, making predictions highly sensitive to small data changes and impairing the model's generalization ability."

    "- model6_linear_form refines model5_linear_form by focusing on significant categorical variables as binary indicators.

Treating categorical variables as binary indicators simplifies their inclusion in the model and maintains the model's predictive capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- model7_linear_form further improves the model by adding interaction terms between key predictors, allowing the model to capture complex relationships between them. The predictors in question are Attack, Speed, Sp. Def, and Sp. Atk. Adding interaction terms can uncover hidden relationships between these predictors and will improve the model's ability to capture the combined influence of multiple variables on HP. However, when doing .summary(), we find that the condition number is 2.34 billion which indicates a very high multicollinearity. This could lead to overfitting and unrealiable predictions. This does not look like the case with our pokemon data split since the R-squares values for In-sample and Out-sample are very close. If we did another random split they might have a huge difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "- model7_linear_form_CS enhances model7_linear_form by centering and scaling the continuous variables Attack, Speed, Sp. Def, and Sp. Atk. What this means is that each variable has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, reducing issues related to differing scales and potentially improving model convergence. This should improve model stability and it does. The condition number is reduced to 15.4 which means multicollinearity is no longer a serious concern in this model and predictions should now be more stable and interpretable."

Of course, if a **fit model** performs well on the **training** dataset but doesn't do as well on the **testing** dataset then we might be observing the affects of **overfitting**. But why might it sometimes be the opposite situation (which we actually encountered right away for `model3_fit` when the **train-test split** was based on  `np.random.seed(130)` and resulted in a better \"out of sample\" **R-squared** of about `0.21` vereses the 'in-sample\" **R-squared** of about `0.15`)? If you're thinking that this should therefore vice-versa intuitively mean **underfitting**, actually that's not right because **underfitting** is when the **generalizability** of a different model **linear form** specification that provides improved **model performance** is **validated**.

    "Meaning of Results:\n",
    "1. Good Generalization: The small difference of 0.088 between in-sample and out-of-sample R-squared values suggests that the model generalizes well, with no severe overfitting. However, with R-squared values mostly below 0.3, the model captures only a small portion of the variance, indicating limited predictive power for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Low Predictive Power: Both R-squared values are low (around 0.15-0.25), indicating the model only explains a limited portion of the variance in the target variable. This could either be because the predictors are weak or because there are other important factors not included. We already established earlier in the HW that it is the latter so we can attribute the low R-squared values to a limited amount of predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. High Variability Across Splits: R-squared values fluctuate significantly across iterations, showing the model's sensitivity to different data splits, which might imply instability or variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of Demonstration:\n",
    "- Without fixing a random seed, each iteration provides a new random split of training and test data. The purpose of this demonstration is to emphasize model robustness across different data splits. The method of running a model on multiple random splits can help assess the stability of model performance metrics, giving insight into how well the model generalizes to new data."

    "> _While we had seemed to **validate** the **generalizability** of `model7_fit` in **model building** exercise of the previous \"Question 7\" above, as well as the improved **model performance** of `model7_fit` comapred to `model6_fit`, the `model7_fit` model was always nonetheless more complex than `model6_fit` model (as seen by comparing their `.summary()` methods). This complexity, despite the minimal concerns regarding **multicollinearity**, should always have suggested some room for caution. This is because, as previously discussed in \"Question 6\" above, a complex **linear form** specification can allow a \"**model fit** to 'detect' idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset.\" Indeed, a close look at the **p-values** in `model7_fit.summary()` will show that the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model7_fit` is in fact not very strong. In comparision, the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model6_fit.summary()` is consistently stronger._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _As discussed towards the end of the commentary in the previous \"Question 7\" above, the primary purpose of **multiple linear regression** methodology is to allow us to assess the **evidence** (in the data) for a given **linear form** specification based on **coefficient hypothesis testing**. In this regard, then, `model6_fit` might be preferred over `model7_fit` despite the better \"out of sample\" **model performance** of `model7_fit` over `model6_fit`. This may not be enough to convince everyone however, so an additional consideration that might be made here is that the more simpler (more parsimoneous) nature of `model6_fit` should be preferred over `model7_fit` from the perspective of **model interpretability**. Indeed, it is quite unclear how exactly one should think about and understand a four-way **interaction** variable such as `Attack:Speed:Q(\"Sp. Def\"):Q(\"Sp. Atk\")` in conjunction with the whole host of the additional lower order interations. From a **model interpretability** perspective, understanding the meaning of the complex specification of `model7_fit` is \"challenging\" and \"complicated\" to say the least._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _There are also often circumstances where **model interpretability** can be MORE IMPORTANT than raw **model performance** in \"out of sample\" **prediction**._\n",
    "> - _This is ESPECIALLY true if **predictive model performance** is relatively comparable between models of two different complexity levels. In such cases, the benefits of better **model interpretability** might provide a clear argument for the simpler (more parsimoneous) model, not to mention the additional potential benefit of more consistent improved **generalizability** over the the more complex model this might offer._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _This question drives home the point that a simpler (more parsimoneous) model always offers the potential benefit of more consistent **generalizability**, not to mention **interpretability**, over more complex models. We should *ONLY* use increasingly complex models that without questions outperfrm simler models. The code below illustrates this by further additionally raising the consideration that the random **train-test** approach used above is actually not the most natural one available for our dataset, which has different \"Generations\". In fact, if we were actually using this model to make **predictions**, we would increasingly acquire more data over time which we would use to make **precictions** about future data which we haven't yet seen, which is what the code demonstrates. And low and behold, this exposes **generalizability** concerns that we missed when we used the dataset in an idealized way and not actually how we would use such a dataset in practice in the real world (where data would arrive sequentially, and current data is used to predict future data). These **generalizability** concerns do affect both models, but the appear to be more problematic for `model7_fit` than `model6_fit`, which is certainly a result of the increased complexity of `model7_fit` which always opens up the possibility of model **overfitting**._\n",

This suggests that training on multiple generations improves generalization to unseen data from the next generation. \n",

The first model has a higher in-sample R-squared with a lower out-of-sample R-squared while the second model has a in-sample R-squared close to the original value with the out-of-sample R-squared being higher than the first model.

    "In all cases, in-sample R-squared values are consistently higher than out-of-sample values. This is typical as models perform better on the data they were trained on, but true test performance is measured by out-of-sample R-squared. Models trained on a single generation perform poorly out-of-sample because they lack exposure to the diversity of data from other generations. In contrast, models trained on Generations 1-5 generally generalize better to Generation 6, as they capture a broader representation of the underlying data. This illustration shows that a model’s generalization ability improves when trained on data that captures a range of variation similar to what it may encounter in future cases."

    "This homework's \"Question 3\" introduced the idea of performing some **multiple linear regression** analyses on dataset from the Canadian Social Connection Survey. While other questions of this homework focussed on other datasets, the general analyses and principles they introduce are no doubt informative and applicable to this the dataset for our course project. Ideally, this should put you in a position to quite proficiently perform **multiple linear regression** analyses for the course project if you so desire and find appropriate for the objectives of you course project submission. Thus, the following (and more) should be possible at this stage... \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select multiple **predictors predictor** from the Canadian Social Connection Survey data and examine how they jointly influence an outcome variable, paying special attention to the inclusion and interpretation of **categorical** and **indicator variables** and **interactions** (in terms of \"baseline\" reference groups and \"contrast\" or \"offsets\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Visualize different kinds of **predictive association** relationships, including **interactions** and relationship between **predictor** and the **outcome** variables that change across different levels of other **categorical** or **indicator predictor variables**, using tools like `plotly.express`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use **coefficient hypothesis testing** and \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** evaluation to perform **model building** and examine **generalizability** of **fitted models**.\n",
    "       \n",
    "4. Assess the presence of **multicollinearity** by considering the **condition numbers** of **fitted models** (with \"centering and scaling\") and their subsequent potential implications on **generalizability** of **fitted models**; and, perhaps even examine **pairwise correlation** and/or **variance inflation factors** for each **predictor variable** if you're feeling extra ambitious and want to go well \"above and beyond\" (in which case you could also consider the relationship between **multicollinearity** and why one level of a **categorical** variable is always omitted).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compare and contrast such analyses and their benefits with previous methodologies introduced and considered in the course.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Explore using model diagnostic to check assess the assumptions of your **multiple linear regression** analyses, and reflect on how failurse of these assumptions might impact the reliability of your findings and conlusions derived from your **fitted model**.\n",
